/* Description
Ever wondered how to assess if the text is hard or easy to read? For a human, this task is pretty simple:
you just read the text and feel if you're struggling or not. But how to teach a computer do that?
In this project, you will write such a program.

Firstly, let's create a simple program. If a text contains more than 100 symbols (including spaces and punctuation),
then it is considered hard to read. Otherwise, the text is considered easy to read. If a text contains exactly 100 symbols,
it is still easy to read.

The input contains a single line of text. Output "HARD" if the text is hard to read and "EASY" if the text is easy to read. */

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        String input = scanner.nextLine();

        if (input.length() > 100) {
            System.out.println("HARD");
        } else {
            System.out.println("EASY");
        }
    }
}
