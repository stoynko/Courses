<!--Welcome to the starting line of your coding race! In this first stage of "Simple Stopwatch,"
imagine you're crafting a sleek stopwatch app tailored for runners gearing up for their big race day.
Your first task is to create the essential HTML elements that will pave the way for a seamless timing experience.

Picture this: the runners are lacing up their shoes, heartbeats quickening with anticipation. As the race director, your HTML toolkit must include:

    • Title (h1): A bold and inspiring header that sets the pace for the challenge ahead. The text should be "Simple Stopwatch".
    • Timer (p): The beating heart of your stopwatch, ready to track every second of the race. The starting text should be "00:00:00".
    • Start, Stop, Reset, Lap Buttons: The control center for our runners, offering the power to kick off, pause, restart, and mark key moments in their journey.

With these elements in place, you're not just building a stopwatch—you're creating a tool that will help runners push their limits and achieve their personal best.
Get ready to code your way to the finish line! On your mark, get set, code!
