<!-- Description:
In the last stage, let's add animation effects to the images from Stage 3 by adjusting their saturation.
When the user hovers over an image, it will transition from its default state to full-color saturation.
This will create a vibrant and dynamic effect.

Objectives:

    • Add class distance-image for all images in the distance list.
    • Apply a saturation of 100% to the images by default.
    • When the user hovers over an image, increase the saturation to 200%.
    • Ensure that the animation effect is consistent for all the images in the list.
