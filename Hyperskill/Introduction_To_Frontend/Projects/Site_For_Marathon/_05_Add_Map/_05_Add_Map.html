<!-- Description:
In this stage, we will enhance the web page by adding the Google map with a starting point.
The map will provide participants and spectators with a visual representation of the race location, ensuring they can easily find their way to the starting point.
You will generate an embedded map using Google Maps and add a title to the map to enhance its visibility.

Objectives:

    • Generate an embedded Google map with the starting point location by following these steps:
        a. Go to Google Maps.
        b. In the Search Google Maps text box, type in the address of the location you want to display on your web page.
           We will use Big Ben as a starting point.
        c. When the map appears, click on the Share icon.
        d. Select the Embed a map tab on the Share window.
        e. Click on the Copy HTML button to obtain the embedded map code.
    • Create a block with the class map-container and place the copied map iframe in it
    • Add a title (h2) to the map with the text See you at Big Ben! to indicate the event location.
    • Position the map and title in an appropriate layout on the web page.
    • Test the map functionality to verify that it displays the correct location and behaves as expected.
