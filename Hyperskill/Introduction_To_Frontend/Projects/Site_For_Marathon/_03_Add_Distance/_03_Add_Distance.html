<!-- Description:
In this stage, we will style the content added in the previous stage. We will adjust the fonts, align the text, and position the content to improve the overall visual
appearance. We will also add a button and a title to the video block and style it. Finally, we will adjust the layout of the running distances list by setting its
maximum width and positioning it in the middle of the page from left to right. We will also adjust the position of the images in the list of items.

Objectives:

    • Inside the block of Youtube iframe-container class, place a block with the video-overlay class after the Youtube iframe.
      This block should contain two tags: h1 and button.
    • Add a title with short motivated content about running in the h1 tag inside the video-overlay class.
      Set the distance from top 150px (using the top property) and center align the text. Make the text color white with a font size of 73px.
    • Set width of video-overlay to 100vw and height equal to the height of youtubeIframe.
      You also have to center the container using flexbox and set the column direction to arrange the elements.
      The heading and button elements inside the video-overlay class must be evenly spaced with the button's text color as white.
    • For more readability, place the video-overlay block under the iframe-container block with YouTube iframe using absolute positioning and add a black background with 50% transparency.
    • Add a button to the video block with padding 5px 10px, a white border (4px) and white color, a transparent background, and text that says Join us!. The font size is 24px.
    • Add the Roboto,Helvetica Neue,Arial,sans-serif fonts for the whole page.
    • Style the list with running distances (distance-container) by giving it a maximum width of 1000px and placing it in the middle of the page from left to right.
      Let the font-size of the header of the list be 32px.
    • Alternate the image position on every list item so the image is on the left for even items and on the right for odd items. Use the float property for this purpose.
      To prevent the list items from hovering over each other, apply the clear and display: table properties to each of them
