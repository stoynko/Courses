/* Description
Let's start with a program that makes you a coffee – virtual coffee, of course. In this project, you will implement functionality that simulates a real coffee machine. 
It can run out of ingredients, such as milk or coffee beans, it can offer you various types of coffee, and, finally, it will take money for the prepared drink. 
Throughout the project, you'll learn how to manage ingredients, take user input, and make decisions based on those inputs.

This stage introduces basic console output that represents the process of making a cup of coffee. 
In the next stages, you will improve the program by adding user interaction and resource management.

Objective
    • The first version of the program just makes you a coffee. Your task is to simulate the coffee-making process by printing each step to the console, 
    showing what the coffee machine does as it makes the drink.

Example Output:
- Starting to make a coffee
- Grinding coffee beans
- Boiling water
- Mixing boiled water with crushed coffee beans
- Pouring coffee into the cup
- Pouring some milk into the cup
- Coffee is ready! */

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        System.out.println("Starting to make a coffee");
        System.out.println("Grinding coffee beans");
        System.out.println("Boiling water");
        System.out.println("Mixing boiled water with crushed coffee beans");
        System.out.println("Pouring coffee into the cup");
        System.out.println("Pouring some milk into the cup");
        System.out.println("Coffee is ready!");

    }
}
